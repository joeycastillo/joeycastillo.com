[Oddly Specific Objects](www.oddlyspecificobjects.com) focuses on designing, manufacturing & selling comprehensible open source objects aimed at the needs of hobbyists and creative technologists.

Its first product, [Sensor Watch](sensorwatch), is a board swap for the classic Casio F-91W wristwatch that puts a ton of extra features on your wrist.

The [LCD FeatherWing](lcdwing), launched shortly thereafter, is a low power liquid crystal display module compatible with Adafruit's Feather ecosystem.

Oddly Specific Objects is a division within Panchromatic LLC, my long-standing software and consulting business. Made official in 2022, it is a new line of business for me, but I hope to grow it more in the coming year. Watch this space.
