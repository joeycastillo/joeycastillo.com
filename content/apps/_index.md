title: Apps, Past & Present
---
Over the years I've had the opportunity to work on dozens of iOS, tvOS and macOS apps. Some of them were for others; others were mine and mine alone.

In the former category, I was the sole developer behind [Food & Wine Magazine's first cocktail guide app](http://www.toquemag.com/eating-and-cooking/food-app-review-of-the-week-food-wine-cocktails) in 2012, and in 2017 I was part of the small team at [Podop](https://www.podop.com) that launched [Steven Soderbergh's Mosaic](https://www.wired.com/story/steven-soderbergh-new-app-mosaic/), an interactive film experience that The Daily Beast called “[the most innovative TV series maybe ever](https://www.thedailybeast.com/steven-soderberghs-mosaic-is-the-most-innovative-tv-series-maybe-ever)”.

I also developed and launched several solo apps over the years, but today only one of these remains on the App Store: [Better Day](/apps/betterday), a highly cuztomizable date complication for the Apple Watch. I had a habit of writing up these projects as I went, though, so my back catalog of a half-dozen solo projects — some dating to the earliest days of the App Store — is presented here for posterity.

As of this moment, I am mostly engaged with mobile app development as a consultant, as my day-to-day focus has shifted to product design and embedded systems engineering. Still I have a deep knowledge of and affection for iOS, tvOS and macOS, and I welcome the opportunity to bring my years of experience on these platforms to clients who have interesting work.
