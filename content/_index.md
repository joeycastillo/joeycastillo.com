Hi! I'm Joey. I make things sometimes:

# [Oddly Specific Objects](objects)

* [Sensor Watch](objects/sensorwatch), a board swap for the classic Casio F-91W wristwatch.
* [LCD FeatherWing](objects/lcdwing), a low-power, Feather-compatible display module.
<!-- * [The Open Book](/objects/openbook), a quixotic attempt to build an open hardware e-reader. -->

# [iOS apps](apps)

* [Better Day](/apps/betterday), Apple Watch app. Feature-complete as of January 2020.
